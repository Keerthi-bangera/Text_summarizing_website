TEXT-SUMMARIZING WEBSITE

Introduction: 
The ability to summarize vast amounts of text data highlights the importance of text summarization tools. These tools efficiently extract valuable information from large content, saving time and effort. Python, with its diverse libraries, offers effective solutions for this task. 


Features of text summarizing web app: 
 
1. Customizable Summary Length :This feature lets users choose how much detail they want in the summary. They can adjust the length, whether they need a brief or more detailed summary. It gives users the exact amount of information they’re looking for. 
 
2. Summary Type :This feature allows users to choose the style of summary they want      Such as:-      Headline-style summary: for quick key points. 
 Bullet-point summary: for easy-to-read lists. 
 Short paragraph summary: for a concise, full-text overview 

3. Summary Evaluation :This feature allows users to evaluate the quality of the generated summary. Automated evaluation tools like ROUGE can also assess the quality. This helps improve the summarization model based on user input and performance metrics. 
 
4. User Feedback :This feature allows users to share their feedback about the summary, like if it’s accurate or relevant. It also allows users to rate it, and they can comment on the summary to suggest improvements. It ensures the summaries meet user needs and keeps improving over time. 

 
Tools and technologies: 
 
1. Python: Backend development: Python is used as the backend programming language to build the web app's logic and integrate the other libraries. 
Scripting and automation: Python's scripting capabilities are used to automate tasks, such as text preprocessing and summarization. 
 
2. NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) :Text preprocessing: NLTK is used to perform text preprocessing tasks, such as tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization. 
Text analysis: NLTK provides tools for text analysis, including sentiment analysis and named entity recognition, which can be used to extract relevant information for summarization. 
 
3. spaCy :Text processing: spaCy is used for high-performance text processing, including tokenization, entity recognition, and language modeling. 
Named Entity Recognition (NER): spaCy's NER capabilities are used to identify and extract key entities from the text, such as names, locations, and organizations. 
 
4. Gensim: Topic modeling: Gensim is used to perform topic modeling on large volumes of    text data, which helps to identify the most important topics and themes in the text. 
Document similarity analysis: Gensim's document similarity analysis capabilities are used to identify the most similar documents or sentences in the text, which helps to extract the most relevant information for summarization. 
 
5. Flask :Web framework: Flask is used as the web framework to build the web app's user interface and API. 
API development: Flask is used to develop the API that exposes the text summarization functionality to the web app's frontend. 

 
TextRank Algorithm: 

The TextRank algorithm is a graph-based ranking algorithm designed to identify the most  important elements in given text. It is inspred by Google’s PagerRank algorithm which ranks web pages based on their importance. 
Text summarization web app is developed using TextRank algorithm that involves   processing the input text at start which is important step in analysing input. It breaks the text into sentences and words using libraries like NLTK, spacy. Text is cleaned and converted to lowercase were it also removes punctuation and stop words. 
The TextRank algorithm builds the graph by transforming each sentence to a node following pre-processing. Edges between each node nodes are weighted by similarity of the sentences. The similarity of the text is calculated by applying Cosine similarity that compares. Vector representation. The vector embeds and captures semantic meaning of the sentences using the a ranking process. The highest ranked sentences that is the sentence that are highly related to other important sentences are ranked higher are deemed the crucial points and chosen for summarization.  The number of sentences selected for summarization are determined by user length.  
Ultimately, the summary is presented in the web application  so that it can be considered by a user in relevant and concise version of the original text. This help users save time by quickly understanding the main points without needing to go whole text. 

 
Working of Text Summarizing Web App: 
 
1. User Input: Users can paste the text that they want to summarise in the text box provided or they can directly upload a document or provide a link of an article . This app can handle various formats so it could be easy for the users to use.  	 	 	   
2. Text Processing: After the input is provided it analyses the content to make sure the information is consistent for the summarizing. It removes common words like 'a','an','the','is','are',etc., which don't have much importance in the text and focuses on important content.The app breaks  the text into smaller parts to make it easier to analyse .All the texts are converted into lowercase as the app doesn't differentiate between uppercase and lowercase words . The special characters or punctual's the don't give specific meaning to the text are discarded . 
 
3. Tokenization: It divides the text as sentences and then checks which sentences are more important and should be included in the summary. It separates the text accordingly to make sure the structure of the summary is proper. 
 
4. Keywords: It identifies the most important keywords. It then analyses the frequency of the keyword and then makes sure to include it in the summary. It give the the most frequented words more importance. 
 
5. Sentence scoring: After tokenization and identifying the keywords is done ,It evaluates each sentences to make sure that the summary gives the original meaning of the original text. It checks if the keywords frequented are included,is the sentence shorter than the original text, the structure is proper and it also makes sure that the summary is logical. 

6. Summarizing algorithm: Once the summarizing is done,the app decides which sentences should be included in the final summary .It uses extractive summarizing algorithm and abstractive summarizing algorithm to summarize. 
 
7. Output: Once the algorithm has completed ,the output is displayed to the user in a shorter version of the original text. 

Conclusion: 
The Text Summarization Web App offers an intuitive solution for users who want to extract meaningful information from lengthy texts. By integrating cutting-edge NLP techniques, machine learning algorithms, and user-focused features, the app simplifies the process of summarization while addressing the growing demand for efficient information processing. Although there are certain challenges, the app offers a strong foundation for further advancements in automated text summarization.
